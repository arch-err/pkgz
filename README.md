# PGKZ

**PKGZ** is a tool to declaratively install packages in a single script.

# Requirements
 - an arch based distro
 - yay installed

# Note

This script is made for an arch-based distribution with `yay` preinstalled but this script can of course be adapted to suit any installation command on any distro.

Also, sorry for the poorly written script (it's a bit slow when you've listed alot of packages). I wrote it in a rush and I'll probably never care about improving it, so feel free to make a PR and I'll gladly take a look at it!
